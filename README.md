## Project Overview

The assignment was to create an index page that linked to three different recipe pages. Each recipe page was to contain a:

- title
- image of the finished recipe
- description
- unordered list of ingredients
- ordered list of steps to make the recipe

## Process

- Created the basic HTML structure of the recipe site and added images and recipe content.
- Created the CSS for the index page (desktop), with also a zoom in hover effect on the images using transform: scale().
- Added a footer copyright statement that updates the year using JavaScript.
- Created the CSS for the recipe pages (desktop) and made square images to use for the recipe pages to have round image effect.
- Refactored the CSS to make DRY.
- Altered images to make smaller and reduced file size using Squoosh.

### What I learned

In the previous lessons on The Odin Project I learnt how to set up a virtual machine (Virtual Box with Xubuntu), how to use terminal commands and basic git instructions. Therefore on this project I worked via the virtual machine and used git commands via a terminal to save the progress of the project to GitHub.
