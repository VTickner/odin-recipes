## Project Overview

The assignment was to create an index page that linked to three different recipe pages. Each recipe page was to contain a:

- title
- image of the finished recipe
- description
- unordered list of ingredients
- ordered list of steps to make the recipe

## Process

- Created the basic HTML structure of the recipe site and added images and recipe content.
- Created the CSS for the index page (desktop), with also a zoom in hover effect on the images using transform: scale().
- Added a footer copyright statement that updates the year using JavaScript.
- Created the CSS for the recipe pages (desktop) and made square images to use for the recipe pages to have a round image effect.
- Refactored the CSS to make DRY.
- Altered images to make smaller and reduced file sizes using Squoosh.
- Added media queries to CSS to create a responsive web design for smaller devices.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - Flexbox
  - Transform: scale()
- JavaScript
  - Update copyright year

### What I learned

In the previous lessons on The Odin Project I learnt how to set up a virtual machine (Virtual Box with Xubuntu), how to use terminal commands and basic Git instructions (clone, add, commit, pull, push). Therefore on this project, I worked via the virtual machine and used git commands via a terminal to save the progress of the project to GitHub.

Whilst I didn't learn any new CSS for this project, I did put into practice into my own design, some techniques I had previously learnt about.

### Continued development

To learn and practice using other Git instructions e.g. git merge.
